So this site is a permanent state of `in progress`.   
I know theres some blemishes here and there, and some basic things needed to be done for presentation.  
 But since this is a spare time project, I am going to have fun with it while not feeling pressure to `do the needful` which we do every day at work.   
 That being said here sort of the summary of what needs to happen around here.  

Things to do are:  
1. Remove the (more...) link if theres not actually more.  
2. The body is like 200% for testing scrollmagic.  Fix that.   
3. Image optimization. The images take a hot second to load.  
4. Categories and better blog organization  
5. The amount of `programmer in a thong content` is currently unacceptable. More pictures of software developers in thongs.  
6. Front end task runner organization. I'm using webpack and just dumping all the Js/Css into single bundles.  I could do better. I will do better. I am the task runner.  
7. Figure out how to sync a static site posts to other social media platforms.  
8. Remove the start, trigger, end from the right side that is being used to test scrollmagic.  

Things I want to do are:  
1. Add Scrollmagic/Greensock to the about page to create a fun interactive scroll site.  
2. Make a video game with html5  
3. Learn blender and start creating cool 3d stuff for the site  


You can guess which ones are happening first.
