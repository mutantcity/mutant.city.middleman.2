We learn a lot in school about algorithms, problem solving, complex systems, OOP and functional languages.  But what about the basic foundations of how to write “good” code?

Working code is only part of the puzzle: maintenance, readability, extensibility, portability, and other factors are all involved in writing good code.

A quick google will give you a lot of articles online that have the Buzzfeed style: “9 ways to improve your code!”

But what do we do that actually makes our code ‘good code’?
Is it mysticism and superstition and we just know it by instinct? Or are there scientific and engineering based laws of what makes ‘good code’ and therefore objective rules on how to craft it?

In this article series I will attempt to elucidate what makes ‘good code’, all the factors that are entailed, and describe objective laws developers can use in their daily work to write good, or at least better, code.  And do this with examples and, hopefully, grounded in as much scientific rigor as is possible… for a subject like this.


Future articles:

Evil dirty things: cyclomatic complexity, large functions, state, side effects, and other treacherous code styles
Premature Optimization is the root of all evil: performance bottlenecks are only on a tiny fraction of the codebase, why not make it readable instead?
Theory of good code: Good code is simply code that reduces employees time spent on a task.
THIS INCLUDES DEVELOPERS: Code maintenance is definitely a task.
Resources: Code complete, Clean code book,  Sandi Metz
Code Quality Automation Tools:  Sonar, Code formatting, etc.
