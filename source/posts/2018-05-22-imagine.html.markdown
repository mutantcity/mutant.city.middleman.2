Or autoscaling groups  
Imagine all the people  
Living life in peace

Best article I've read in a long while about the future of web dev.  
They hit on the key points: serverless frameworks, JWT, Vue.js, hosting your front-end in S3.  
No scaling issues, no complicated deployments, nothing but love.  
And that, my broskies, is truly all you need. (and also money to pay bills)
