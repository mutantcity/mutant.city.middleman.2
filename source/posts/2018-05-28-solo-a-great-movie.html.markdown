*"Ive got a really good feeling about this."*  - Han Solo

My primary concern with the Disney run Star Wars is the Marvelization of the Star Wars franchise which has disturbed me about the recent Star Wars movies. Emphasis on large, undecipherable action scenes,  plots centering around large magic items or dubious goals that the audience has to dumbly accept as important,  incredibly oversimplistic motivations for characters who wield massive power. I know it sells because I think most people like these kinds of  movies as a break from their lives but that's not what made the original Star Wars so special.  It was the depth of the universe, the hero's journey, the philosophy of the dark/light balance, the mythos surrounding the characters and world, love of family and tribe(and species). Not just characters with superpowers that have to fight bigger characters with superpowers to stop certain destruction. In Marvel the characters and plot serve the action in the original Star Wars the action served the characters and plot.

  This movie could have gone bad in so many numerous ways.  Formalizing the mythos of Han Solo into hard canon and codifying the imaginations of legions of fans into the big screen is a very dicey proposition, walking a tightrope over a river of crocodiles, except instead of a crocodile extinction, a billion dollar franchise is at stake as well as the respect of a notoriously rabid fan base.
  Han Solo is as sacred of a character in the Star Wars franchise as any,  with all the surrounding mythos that fans have grown up dreaming about and idealizing for decades. (*Where did those dice come from?* )  Everything has to go just *perfectly*. Therefore, I admire the courage and gusto required to make this movie.  
  That being said, I really, truly, enjoyed the movie itself. Summarizing a rich history into two hours isn't easy and requires tradeoffs of screenplay and action, character development and plot advancement, while still fleshing out our imagination of Han's lifes properly, and was done outstandingly as far as I'm concerned.

  The swaggering, snarky, charming, ladies man, tough guy with a heart of gold that Harrison Ford portays so perfectly that its almost unimaginable it could ever have been without him. It's like Rocky without Stallone or Lector without Hopkins...characters so enmeshed with the actual actor, that portraying the character is equal parts portraying the actor themselves.
  
  
  
  and a billion dollar franchise at stake.
  
  Just a slight imperfection in any of the well known characters, flimsy screenwriting,  unsatisfactory amounts of swagger and snark  and charm from the lead himself.
  
  And to be hon

 could have caused huge fan backlash, further hastening the decline of the Star Wars franchise. 


The Marvelization of Star Wars does continue
